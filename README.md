# Framework: Online course starter for R

This  course repo is based on the
[framework](https://github.com/ines/spacy-course) that [Ines Montani](https://twitter.com/_inesmontani) developed for her
[spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io). The front-end is powered by
[Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and the
back-end code execution uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org). check out the the framework and it's basics [here](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r) or delve [a little bit deeper](https://github.com/ines/spacy-course).
