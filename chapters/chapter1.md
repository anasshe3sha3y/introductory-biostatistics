<exercise id="3" title="Statistical terminology">

  This is a code exercise. The content can be formatted in simple Markdown â€“Â so
  you can have **bold text**, `code` or [links](https://spacy.io) or lists, like
  the one for the instructions below.

  - These are instructions and they can have bullet points.
  - The code block below will look for the files `exc_01_03`, `solution_01_03` and
  `test_01_03` in `/exercises`.

<exercise id="4" title="Statistical software" type="slides">

During your research, you will have to use software for data analysis; statistics include some of the nastiest mathematical formulas and sometimes even computers find an exact solution for these (The formulas are not really hard to understand they're just hard to compute! ~~I am lying they are so hard they'll make you feel pain~~). Although the laws of statistics are universal, You can't just use any software (or create your own). if you want your research to get published you'd better use a **validated** or **peer-reviewed** software.

Following is a list of some of the most popular softwares that can perform statistical analyses. we are only introducing you to the *big names* you will be hearing a lot when you start working in the research field. but we are not asking you to learn all of them, or even memorize them. In your journey with CRA, we are going to teach you how to use **SPSS** (and probably some **R**). but feel free to learn your own software!

#Statistical Programs
You will be able to interact with these softwares with a mouse, press buttons that correspond to statistical tests and other tasks. they are similar to most of the programs you deal with in a computer (unless you are secretly a programmer!ðŸ’»ðŸ’»ðŸ’»).

###Microsoft Excel
We do not recommend using Microsoft Excel for research!!! therefore we will not discuss it here. we discuss the reasons for this comment in sessions.

###SPSS
We will be demonstrating most of the statistical procedures you learn with us using SPSS. SPSS was developed by ![IBM](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IBM_logo.svg)
<slides source="chapter1_01_introduction"><\slides>

which of the following software packages should you use to perform linear regression (a very common statistical procedure)?
<choice>
<opt text="SPSS" correct="true">Good job!ðŸŽ¯</opt>
<opt text="Excel">due to the absence of 'data lineage' and 'scripting capabillities', Excel is not recommended for research purposes. we discuss this topic more deeply in sessions</opt>
<opt text="Paint MS">we wish that was correct but nope!!!ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢</opt>
</choice>


#Programming Languages

###R
```r
plot(cars)
```

Other software packages that could be used for statistical analysis include the programs: Minitab, Stata, SAS,  and the programming languages: Python, Julia, Matlab.

Which of the following programming languages is renowned for its use in Statistical analysis
<choice>
<opt text="SPSS">SPSS is not a pragramming language.</opt>
<opt text="R" correct="true">Good job!ðŸŽ¯</opt>
<opt text="C++">C++ is not renowned for its use in statistical analysis</opt>
